# \# Fortnite Tournament Simulator##### \## Solo queue chaos, broadcast vibes, and way too many crashesThis is a Python-based, **text-driven** solo Fortnite tournament simulator that tries to feel like you're watching actual comp.Think FNCS Grand Finals (or other tournaments, whatever you fancy), if the lobby was filled with the 100 best pros on the region, battling constantly.It simulates tournaments, seasons, player performances, and unpredictable events through a modular mod system.###### **## Current Version**: v1.2.0 (January 2026)This project is a hobby project and is actively evolving.#### **## Features*** Solo tournament simulation -- pick your type!
